Network devices are missing on cold boot
Quickly logging in through SDDM causes it to freeze
Keystore doesn't unlock on login

Screenshot of a window take a screenshot of all windows on the workspace
Rofi click-on-exit not working
Mic tooltip on statusbar can't be shown properly

Changing workspace doesn't close quick one

Waking up with no monitors breaks hyprlock and doesn't issue fallback

Auto login and remove SDDM
