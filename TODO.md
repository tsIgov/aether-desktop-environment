Deal with popup screens (file roller, copying, file chooser, screen sharing, network manager, audio manager, clipse)
screen casting
Configure XDG (notes in digital brain) - file manager
Move printer drivers outside of aether?
easily call GC
Record screen
Reconfigure Firefox
Clicking on system icon should open gotop

## Optional

Change polkit with the one from hyprland
Add micro instead of nano? (set $EDITOR)
add screenshot to clipboard + annotation?
Use clipboard via rofi

Quickly logging in through SDDM causes it to freeze
Keystore doesn't unlock on login
Screenshot of a window take a screenshot of all windows on the workspace
Swaylock breaks on monitor switch
Rofi click-on-exit not working
Mic tooltip on statusbar can't be shown properly

## Refactor
 - waybar
	- calendar tooltop is weird
	- refactor submap and language
	- color icons on events
 - rofi
	- switching to calc animation (separate calc from the main rofi window)
 - notifications
	- hotkeys
