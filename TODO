## Usability
Add scripts for easier switch and toggling registries
hyprpanel has hardcoded terminal

Anyrun or rofi
Clipboard manager (and file system?) should be inside user
Clipboard gets cleared on app close

Add micro instead of nano? (set $EDITOR)
Locale should be configured per user

Reconfigure Hyprland
	- Check plugins
	- Configure monitors
	- Configure hotkeys (including those for notifications) (should they be configured in a single place)
	- Deal with popup screens (file roller, copying, file chooser, screen sharing, network manager, audio manager, clipse)


screen casting
Configure XDG (notes in digital brain)
Check storage (gnome-usage gnome-system-monitor htop gotop)
wallpaper? (also for lockscreen)
Migrate to hyprlock if wallpapers will be used
Configure lockscreen


Should the deployment script update the flake locks? Currently they are set to path instead of github.
