## Usability
Replace anyrun
Clipboard manager (and file system?) should be inside user
Clipboard gets cleared on app close
Should I enable xdg-desktop-portal-gtk (global dark theme is not recognized)
Add micro instead of nano? (set $EDITOR)
Better network manager gui
Locale should be configured per user

Move common stuff to presets
Reconfigure Hyprland
	- Check plugins
	- Configure monitors
	- Configure hotkeys (including those for notifications) (should they be configured in a single place)
	- Deal with popup screens (file roller, copying, file chooser, screen sharing, network manager, audio manager, clipse)




screen casting
Configure XDG (notes in digital brain)
shutdown, reboot, sleep, hibernate (runner?)
Check storage (gnome-usage gnome-system-monitor htop gotop)
wallpaper? (also for lockscreen and display manager)
Migrate to hyprlock if wallpapers will be used


Should the deployment script update the flake locks? Currently they are set to path instead of github.
