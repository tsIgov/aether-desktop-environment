## Usability
Refactor user modules
	- Home manager should not install packages related to the desktop environment
	- Remove the default values of user options?
	- Rename the anyrun, hyprland, daemons, utilities and waybar folders
	- Move browser and utilites away from the desktop-environment folder
	- Settings of currently installed stuff (browser, terminal, digital brain, anyrun, mako)


Reconfigure Hyprland
	- Check plugins
	- Configure monitors
	- Configure hotkeys (including those for notifications) (should they be configured in a single place)
	- Deal with popup screens (file roller, copying, file chooser, screen sharing, network manager, audio manager, clipse)

screen casting

Configure XDG (notes in digital brain)
use hyprlock instead of swaylock?
bluethooth (overskride)
shutdown, reboot, sleep, hibernate
Check storage (gnome-usage gnome-system-monitor htop gotop)
