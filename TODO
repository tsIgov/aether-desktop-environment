Anyrun should use the clipboard manager
Clipboard gets cleared on app close

Battery icon is empty

Add micro instead of nano? (set $EDITOR)

	- Don't open new window at master
	- Introduce variables
	- Window open animation
	- Clamshell
	- Configure monitors
	- Configure hotkeys (including those for notifications) (should they be configured in a single place)
	- Deal with popup screens (file roller, copying, file chooser, screen sharing, network manager, audio manager, clipse)

screen casting
Configure XDG (notes in digital brain)
Check storage (gnome-usage gnome-system-monitor htop gotop)
